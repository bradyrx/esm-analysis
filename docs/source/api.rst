API Reference
=============

This page provides an auto-generated summary of esm_analysis's API.
For more details and examples, refer to the relevant chapters in the main part of the documentation.

Carbon
~~~~~~

.. automodsumm:: esm_analysis.carbon
    :functions-only:
    :toctree: api
    :skip: check_xarray, linear_regression, nanmean, rm_poly

Composite Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. automodsumm:: esm_analysis.composite
    :functions-only:
    :toctree: api
    :skip: check_xarray, ttest_ind_from_stats, standardize

Conversions
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. automodsumm:: esm_analysis.conversions
    :functions-only:
    :toctree: api
    :skip: check_xarray

Grid Tools
~~~~~~~~~~

.. automodsumm:: esm_analysis.grid
    :functions-only:
    :toctree: api

MPAS Model Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Functions related to analyzing output from the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) ocean model. Since the grid is comprised of unstructured hexagons, analysis and visualization is not as straight-forward as working with regularly gridded data. The best visualizations on the unstructured grid can be made in ParaView.
